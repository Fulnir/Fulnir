  # Hi there 👋 I'm Edwin
  
</div>

   and an electrical engineer who worked for a while as a freelance Smalltalk developer for government agencies and insurance companies. 
   I have been using Smalltalk since 1993: Digitalk/V, SmalltalkAgents, SmallScript, VisualAge, Squeak (Apple Smalltalk), Pharo, and VisualWorks. 
   Other programming languages I've used over the years include Realbasic, Objective-C, Scala, Dart, Elixir, and Swift. And before that: Basic, Pascal, Pearl, Lisp and Assembler.
                
   The design of my programs should be aesthetic but as little design as possible.
