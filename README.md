  # Hi there üëã I'm Edwin
  
</div>

I'm an electrical engineer with extensive experience as a freelance Smalltalk developer for government agencies and insurance companies. I've been using Smalltalk since 1993, including versions such as Digitalk/V, SmalltalkAgents, SmallScript, VisualAge, Squeak (Apple Smalltalk), Pharo, and VisualWorks. Additionally, I've worked with other programming languages over the years, including Realbasic, Objective-C, Scala, Dart, Elixir, and Swift. Before that, I used Basic, Pascal, Pearl, Lisp, and Assembler.

I believe that program design should be aesthetic but involve as little design as possible.

What else? Oh yes, I'm a passionate runner! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you develop apps for MacOS, iOS, iPadOS, or other systems, whether you use Xcode, Visual Code, Swift, SwiftUI, or any other programming language, 
          then you will certainly also create a release notes file for changes to your software. The Changelog Publisher supports you in this.
          This native Mac application allows you to create change notes quickly and easily and publish them in various formats.

Create new releases and add your changes to them. You can also list the commits of your repository and transfer them to your changelog at the click of a mouse if required. 
      You can customize or create templates for different targets. You can then export the changelog to these targets. This can be a rich text file that serves as a source for an 
      about panel in your app, a release notes page on your website, or a text file that you want to post to your feed in X or another social media service.
      Or you can create a WhatToTest file for TestFlight.

The Beta testing program allows you to receive updates before
              everyone else! The program gives you the opportunity to
              participate closely with us on providing the best experience. It
              helps us improving the overall app quality, as well as securing
              high quality updates by checking for any issues or irregularities
              happening in the releases.
